Hello! These are my favorite resources for learning Latin and ancient Greek.

I've tried to add variety to the list to give you, dear learner, plenty of options. If you get tired of one resource, don't hesitate to try something else. We learn best when we‚Äôre most interested!

Many of the resources below are free, or free to borrow at Internet Archive. Resources that cost money are marked with a dollar sign (üí≤).

## Latin writing

Writing is just another way to internalize the language, so that your reading becomes more fluent. [Here's a guide](https://latinitium.com/latin-prose-composition-books-and-method/) on how to get the most out of these Latin composition books.

Hello! These are my favorite resources for learning Latin and ancient Greek.

I've tried to add variety to the list to give you, dear learner, plenty of options. If you get tired of one resource, don't hesitate to try something else. We learn best when we‚Äôre most interested!

Many of the resources below are free, or free to borrow at Internet Archive. Resources that cost money are marked with a dollar sign (üí≤).

# Communities

- [Textkit](https://www.textkit.com/greek-latin-forum/)
- [Humanitas](https://www.conventiculum.com/2023-english) holds online Latin immersion workshops, including a track for beginners. As long as you know the basics of Latin ([see below](#first-steps-grammar)) you can join in. It's a lot of fun because there are many "regulars" who show up every time, and after a couple of workshops you might be old friends already.
- [Conventiculum Dickinsoniense](https://blogs.dickinson.edu/dcc/2022/11/09/conventiculum-dickinsoniense-2023/) is a similar workshop but in-person.
- [Œ£œçŒΩŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ ·ºëŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ](https://www.polisjerusalem.org/program/2022-synodos-hellenikos-%E1%BC%91%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%E1%BD%B8%CF%82-%CF%83%CF%8D%CE%BD%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%82) by the Polis Institute is similar workshop for ancient Greek.

## Grammar as a first step in Latin

I myself found it helpful to study and memorize basic grammar before moving on to reading and writing. Here are some options for learning grammar:

- üí≤[Latin by the Ranieri-Dowling Method](https://luke-ranieri.myshopify.com/products/latin-by-the-ranieri-dowling-method-latin-summary-of-forms-of-nouns-verbs-adjectives-pronouns-audio-grammar-tables). [Here's a video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yflqUWKVVc) by the author.
- At this point I suggest moving on to reading and writing, but if you want more grammar:
  - [*Latin: A Structural Approach*](https://archive.org/details/latinstructurala00swee)
  - [*Wheelock's Latin*](https://archive.org/details/wheelockslatin0000whee), despite valid criticisms against it, is handy because it has an answer key in the back.

## Reading Latin

Another good exercise is to write a daily journal in Greek. You'll need Greek-English dictionaries ([links above](#dictionaries-to-keep-handy-1)).
